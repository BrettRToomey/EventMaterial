# Unit Testing Objective-C in Swift

I've added two versions of the project I walked through in my presentation. One represents the project before I started refactoring and adding tests, the other represents the final version after refactoring and all tests:

* [TheBodega_First](TheBodega_First/)
* [TheBodega_Last](TheBodega_Last/)

I've also included the code snippets that I used to get from the first to the last version. Each snippet replaces a complete header, implementation or test file. If you want to import the snippets into Xcode you should place them here:

**~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/CodeSnippets**
