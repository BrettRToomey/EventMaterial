I've added the PDF with the slides of my talk [here](Sourcery.pdf).

The ðŸ”®Sourcery framework can be found at [https://github.com/nodes-ios/Sourcery](https://github.com/nodes-ios/Sourcery). 

The demo project I showed during my talk can be found at [https://github.com/mariusc/SourceryDemo](https://github.com/mariusc/SourceryDemo). For the PagedSourcery example to work, you need to get an API key from [http://www.brewerydb.com/developers](http://www.brewerydb.com/developers) to have access to the BreweryDB API.
